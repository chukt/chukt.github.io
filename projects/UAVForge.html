    Back in 2011, DARPA created the UAVForge competition. The competition had many requirements such as the size and technical elements which included sustained surveillance, noise reduction features and vertical takeoff. None of 140 teams managed to fulfill the requirements. UAV Forge was created in response whose sole purpose was to create a drone capable of passing all their requirements and successfully navigate the course. <br><br> 
    I was on the avionics team and responsible for the software side of the UAV. I was given multiple sensors to integrate onto the UAV that helped with navigation, power and other aspects of the UAV. We used an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi to program the UAV and all the code I wrote for it was in C. I worked with UAV Forge for a year and I wrote code for an automated power monitoring system to track the UAV's battery usage. It allowed the UAV to monitor its power levels and to abort the mission in case it did not have enough power to continue. I also configured a compass module to aid the UAV in determining its direction.<br><br><br><br>
    <b>My thoughts:</b> UAV Forge was the first large-scale organization I had to write code for. I've never done so and I've learned one important thing about it: buying things and getting organized takes <u>time</u>. I was really surprised how much time and paperwork it took to get sensors and parts ordered. <br><br>
    Besides ordering parts, I was also surprised how hard it was to communicate to sensors. First, we had to decide which communication protocol to use (it was I2C) and then there were troubles with the actual connections. Sometimes, the sensors would just be broken. Other times, it would be a slight problem with the code. Despite progress being very slow and the situation very frustrating, it ended up still being a valuable experience. I don't really have a chance to work with hardware and it was my first time working with 10+ people in a team. If I had to go back though, I think I'd like to have a bit more experience with low level programming. Datasheets were hard to read and since I had very little low level experience, I needed a lot of mentoring. It was thanks to the open-source community that I managed to code up the sensors and my project lead that I managed to finish coding up several sensors. <br><br>
