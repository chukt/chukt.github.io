      This list of projects is definitely not a comprehensive list of projects I've worked on, but these are some of my favorite projects. All of these projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/chukt" style="color: #C0C0C0">github</a>. <br><br>
      <a href="projects/nasa.html"><b>NASA/JPL Global Warming Project</b></a><br>
      A program written in Python to simulate the progression of the Antartic and Greenland ice sheets. The GUI allowed users to recreate the effect of the increase of snow on ice sheets.

    <b>DoYouEvenConnect</b><br>
      An artificial intelligence written in Java that played Connect K with either another AI or player. Incrementally designed and improved, the AI went through multiple revisions using different algorithms like minimax with alpha-beta pruning to reduce the time it took to make a move.

      <a href="projects/UAVForge.html"><b>UAV Forge</b></a><br>
      Created because of the 2011 DARPA competition. Its mission is to be able to create an autonomous VTOL-capable (vertical take-off and landing) drone for tactical deployment by military operators.

    <b>Digital Braille</b><br>
    A project started at the very first AthenaHacks hackathon. It allows the blind to read an image's text just by inserting the image into the program. From there, it ran the image through an API that parsed text and translated the text into Braille, which was then visually tested by an LED system wired to an Intel Edison.
