      <h3>A Little About Myself</h3>
		<p>
      <br><br>I graduated from the University of California, Irvine with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Currently, I'm working at CONTAX as a technical consultant focused on programming in Java, SQL and a bit of JavaScript using the SAP UI5 framework.<br>
		<br>A few things I've dabbled in: <br>
		</p>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Databases</li>
			<li>Android apps</li>
			<li>IoT</li>
			<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
			<li>Web development</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	<p>
	<br><br>I am a jack-of-all trades; I could do a bit of everything. I like challenges and could always use some feedback. I am willing to learn and try new technology, for I am interested in always improving my skills.<br><br>

    Presently, I'm most interested in the process of problem solving. I believe the beauty of coding is not only getting an answer that's correct, but to code something that functions <b>well</b>. <br><br>

	For a snapshot of my work and other projects I have been working on, here is my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>.<br><br><br><br>

	<h4>Life Outside of Code?</h4>
	<p>
	<br><b>I love teaching and mentoring!</b><br><br>
	Besides the classes I've tutored and camps I've taught (details included in my resume), I've also been tutoring math and reading since high school at a Kumon. It's been about 5 years.
	Needless to say, I've been teaching and tutoring for a long time. I also moved to mentor younger Girl Scouts after 10+ years of being a Girl Scout myself. <br><br>

	Additionally, I have a variety of other interests. I'm an avid reader and writer. I also like sports! Archery and tennis have to be my two favorite sports. I'm also no stranger to the outdoors as I've gone camping and hiking quite a few times.
	There's lots more about me but feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
