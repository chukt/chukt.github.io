      <h3>Hello!</h3>
  <p> A little about myself: I recently graduated with a Computer Science and Engineering degree from UCI. I've dabbled in a lot of things in my school career: databases, Android apps, IoT, artificial intelligence, and of course, web development. I'm sort of a jack-of-all-trades (though not even close to being a master at anything, unfortunately). However, I'm always willing to learn. Everything interests me in some way shape or form. <br><br>
    
    Feel free to look directly at my <a href="resume.pdf" target="_blank"><u>resume</u></a> if you'd like a snapshot of projects and work I've been involved in. <br><br>
    
    Currently, I'm most interested in the process of problem solving. I believe I can code. Howevever, the beauty of coding is not only getting an answer that's correct, but to code something that works <b>well</b>. I am now in the process of figuring that out.
